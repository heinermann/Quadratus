Quadratus
=========

This is a demo originating from a Three.js demo on orthographic cameras. 

Quadratus, latin for square (among other things), is meant to create a 
platform for creating simple maps based on squares and heights with ramps 
to experiment with path finding and other 3D things we cannot even think of now.

This does not work entirely as is, but it is progressively being fixed.
